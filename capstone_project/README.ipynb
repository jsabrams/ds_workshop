    "The Lending Club provides peer-to-peer loans, allowing individual lenders to invest in a portfolio of loans. The Lending Club provides it's own risk assessment and funds a loan at an internally selected interest rate. Lenders can then purchase part of the loan for their portfolio. To inform lender decisions, the Lending Club provides information about the borrower and makes historic loan data available. Here, I develop a series of models to predict default risk in the Lending Club's historic loan data."

However, I do not recommend using these features if the goal is to generate a risk model to set interest rates and loan amounts. The reason is that these features are based on the Lending Club's in-house risk-assessment tools, so these features limit our ability to objectively assess the risk of default outside of the Lending Club context."

A single loan or batch of loans can be passed to either predict_default_tree or predict_default_ensemble, and those functions will output a probability of default. Note that the classifier files are saved and uploaded for the decision tree. The classifier files for the stacked ensemble learner are too big to be uploaded to GitHub. As such, I have included train_ensemble.py. When run, that function will generate all of the files for the stacked ensemble learner."
